# Pytorch Boiler

A minimalistic boiler plate code for training pytorch models.


Current Functionalities:

* Train / Inference loop
* Separate forward and infer modes handling no_grad
* Tracking training / validation loss
* Loading / Saving model, optimizer and tracker state_dict
* 30-line example


TODO:

* Writing custom metrics for tracking
* Support Apex Amp training
* Support for torchscript
